\chapter{User Stories}
    
   Project based user stories are created to try and comprehend the scope of the project's  base user requirements .  As one of the prerequisites for the project report,  The following initial User stories were created so characterize the user requirements for the calculator and its overarching functionalities, \\
   There are \textbf{two global constraints} for the UPCcalculator, \begin{enumerate}
   
       \item All of the processed results for \textbf{Arithmetic operands} should output for in at least 2 Decimal places.
       \item All output displays of the calculator should be defined and formatted with consistency to allow users recognise outputs more easily.
   \end{enumerate}
   
   
   \noindent User Stories are prioritize based on the hypothesized domain knowledge of the concrete architecture of a calculator and the actual user requirements for the UPC Calculator a illustrated in the previous deliverable  , Variables such functional dependencies also contributed to the prioritization decisions to streamline the implementation process and conserve time. The \textbf{Fibonacci Sequence} was used for user story estimation.

\chapter{Implementation}

The  Universal Parabolic (\textbf{UPC calculator}) calculator is implemented in the form of an conditional based calculator, where the user can perform calculations based on their selection of parameters/operands. The calculator also utilizes the Universal parabolic constant to calculate the approximate point distance from a parabolic arc. both of which are implemented from scratch in JAVA without the use of any library functions. executable JAR files can be found side the source code, to allow an easier analysis of the calculator's functions. 
\hfill\break\\
\noindent The Source of the calculator can be found on the linked repository or attached to this document in a later section. Furthermore, 

\section{User Stories Implemented}

The following user stories were implemented in the UPC calculator, the User story selections were based purely on prioritization hierarchy of the stories, the functional requirements and the overall domain requirements of a calculator's core functionalities.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\textbf{ US1} - Select and allow Numerical input
    \item \textbf{US2} - Select Operands for Calculations
    \item \textbf{US3} - Calculate the Universal Parabolic Constant
    \item \textbf{US4} - Calculate the average distance from arc of parabola
\end{enumerate}

\section{Acceptance Testing}
The user stories acceptance tests were conducted in code using a sandbox implementation of \textbf{Junit (Unit Testing)} for every core calculator class. this was done to streamline the testing process of the calculator's functions and allow easier future development/analysis of the UPC calculator.   

\section{Code Structure}

The java implementation was I done ion the utilizing the memento design pattern. all of the calculator's functions were dedicated to their on method classes to allow for easier code maintainability and reuseability, the momentocache Class was utilized to store the users numbers temporally for calculation and result purposes.  


\section{Additional Functionalities}

The calculator features a error handler to allow the user to reenter their selections even if they make mistakes, furthermore additional UI formation was done to the output of the calculator to allow the users with ease of user when using the calculator and understanding the results.
